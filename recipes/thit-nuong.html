        <h2>About the recipe:</h2>
            <p>This quintessential rice dish of Vietnamese pork chops is packed with flavor, super easy to make, and a crowd pleaser!</p>
            <p>The marinade adds a ton of garlicky, lemongrassy flavor that pairs great with the pork chops. Grilling adds an amazing aroma and sear, and as if the chops aren’t flavorful enough, they’re topped with scallions & oil.</p>

        <h2>Prepping for pork chops</h2>
            <p>A cool trick for these “Asian pork chops” is to snip the pork chops around the edges like these. About 3-5 cuts per chop, about 1″ deep each. It looks kinda cool once you grill them up, but the important thing is that the pork chops will stay flat.</p>
