        <h2>About the recipe:</h2>
            <p>Gà xào sả ớt is an aromatic blend of chile sauce, lemongrass, tender chicken, and veggies, but more importantly it’s a fast and easy, one-pot dish that you can make during the week.</p>
            <p>Also known as Vietnamse spicy lemongrass chicken, this dish is more commonly made at-home in Vietnam vs. restaurants (even though it was the most popular dish at my mom’s Vietnamese restaurant).</p>

        <h2>The chicken</h2>
            <p>In Vietnam, this dish usually includes bone-in chicken because that is the easiest, most natural form to serve meat–you don’t get a choice to waste any parts of the chicken! However, In my mom’s old restaurant this recipe was the most popular item amongst the Silicon Valley locals because it was very accessible. </p>
            <p>For this recipe, my ideal combination is thigh and chicken breast to get the best of both worlds. Another option if you’re vegetarian and needing that lemongrass high is using crispy fried tofu instead of chicken.</p>
